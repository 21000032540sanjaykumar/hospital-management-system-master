# JAVA FULLSTACK PROJECT BASED ON HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

This Hospital Management System exemplifies a Java full-stack application, demonstrating the power of modern web technologies for healthcare administration. The frontend, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensures a responsive and intuitive user interface. The backend, built on the Spring framework, provides a robust and scalable foundation for handling diverse functionalities.

The system is structured around four key modules: Admin, Doctor, Pharmacist, and Receptionist. Each module is tailored to address the specific needs of the corresponding roles within a healthcare facility. The MySQL database serves as a secure and efficient repository for managing and retrieving data.

By adopting a full-stack Java approach, this project exemplifies best practices in software development, offering a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly solution for hospital management. Whether it's streamlining administrative tasks or enhancing patient care, this system contributes to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare operations.
